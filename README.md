# C Templates
## Summary
Hi everyone! In this repo you will find some headers with useful macros and templates regarding:
- **Bit manipulation macros**: Useful to make low level code readable.
- **ARM macros**: By now there is only a header for manipulating the DWT register and perform time measurements in your code.
- **Error Logging**: An abstraction layer between your implementation and the error handling, useful for debugging.
- **State machines**: Templates with typical FSM implementations, useful to have a well defined generic structure that you can reuse in other        projects.

#### Thanks for passing by!
