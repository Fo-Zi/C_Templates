# State machines
## Summary
Hi everyone! Here you'll find state machine templates that use different approaches:
- The classical approach of using conditionals inside the main (or infinite loop for embedded systems)
- The table driven approach in which you can define a single function that can handle the transitions by passing
  the current state and last event as arguments. Having then a single function call inside the main.
  
I will probably add a bunch more if i have the chance of implementing the templates in a more complex project.
#### Thanks for passing by!
